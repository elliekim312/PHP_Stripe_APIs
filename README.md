# Stripe

Online payment APIs for one time and recurring payments.

`composer require stripe/stripe-php`

# What I covered

1. Create stripe_customer_id by user name and email address (you can track the customer payments with one id.)

2. Create recurring payment

3. Validate promotion code

4. Cancel the subscription

5. Delete the subscription immediately

6. Re-Activate the subscription

7. Webhooks from stripe

   - webhooks : a notification from Stripe APIs once something you set up is changed.
